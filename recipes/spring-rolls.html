<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Spring rolls are filled with minced vegetables, seafood, poultry, or meat, folded into a food wrapper made from dough or rice paper that is rolled after being folded and is then baked, deep fried, or steamed. They may also be served fresh with a prepared wrapper that is ready to eat after being filled with ingredients.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Wombok, finely shredded</li>
    <li>Medium carrots, peeled and grated</li>
    <li>Cornflour</li>
    <li>Oyster sauce</li>
    <li>Beansprouts, trimmed</li>
    <li>Spring roll wrappers, thawed</li>
    <li>Sweet and sour sauce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic, stir quickly, then add pork. Cook, breaking it up as you go, until it turns white</li>
    <li>Add carrot, bean sprouts, cabbage and mushrooms. Cook for 3 minutes or until vegetables are wilted. Add cornflour, soy sauce and Oyster sauce, cook for 1 minute until the liquid is gone. The Filling should not be watery</li>
    <li>Cool Filling</li>
    <li>Mix cornflour and water in a small bowl (for sealing the rolls)</li>
    <li>Carefully peel off one spring roll wrapper, keep the others covered under a damp tea towel</li>
    <li>Place the wrapper with the SMOOTH SIDE DOWN in a diamond position. Place a very heaped dessert spoon of filling on the bottom. Roll up halfway, fold sides in, then finish rolling. Use cornflour sludge to seal. (Watch VIDEO below). They should be about 12 cm / 5″ long, 2.5cm / 1″ wide once wrapped.</li>
    <li>Pour enough oil in a wok or large saucepan (Note 4) so it is double the height of the spring rolls. Heat on medium high until hot – stick a bamboo chopstick or wooden spoon handle in, if rapid bubbles appear, then it’s hot enough.</li>
    <li>Carefully place spring rolls in the oil (about 4 – 5 at a time) and cook, turning occasionally, until deep golden – around 1 1/2 – 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
    <li>Repeat with remaining spring rolls. Serve while hot with Sweet and Sour Sauce!</li>
